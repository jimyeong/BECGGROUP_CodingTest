## What I considered for making it

- I wanted to use Context Api actually, but using Redux was suggested in the document. so I thought about which data should I put up on the store and which data I shouldn't

- I've left small ideas around all the code, they have mainly have a thing to do with the number of times whenever react gets updated and the level of each state updating
